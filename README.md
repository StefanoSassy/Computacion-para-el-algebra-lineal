# Computational Methods for Teaching Linear Algebra

This repository focuses on basic matrix operations and their implementation in Python. Initially, the code is written without using external libraries like NumPy, and then the same operations are implemented using NumPy to compare syntax and efficiency. The repository aims to demonstrate the benefits of using libraries like NumPy for numerical computations while also providing insight into the fundamental concepts of matrix manipulation.

## Repository Outline:
1. **Matrix Operations**: Implementation of basic matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, and transposition.
2. **Comparison with NumPy**: The same operations are implemented using NumPy, and the syntax and performance are compared.
3. **Tensor Algebra**: Introduction to tensor algebra and how it can be applied to improve matrix operations.
4. **TensorFlow**: Demonstration of how TensorFlow can be used to optimize tensor operations for machine learning applications.

## Objective:
The goal of this repository is to enhance the understanding of matrix and tensor operations, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, while showcasing the power of modern computational libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow.
